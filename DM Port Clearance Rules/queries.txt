ground queries using the top-level predicate MayEnterDutchPortUnloaded applied to specific ship instances
local:MayEnterDutchPortUnloaded(local:ship1)
Yes

local:MayEnterDutchPortUnloaded(local:ship7)
No

A non-ground query to :MayEnterDutchPortUnloaded, using output variable ?x  to deduce ships that may enter a Dutch port 
local:MayEnterDutchPortUnloaded(?w)

Query over the KB in a bottom-up traversal manner. We start with the object-centered-query portion of this traversal. This query can be proved by Rule 1&5 and the h7 frame embedded inside the ship7 fact.
local:status( h7 local:clean )
Yes

Next query asks whether the hold ?h of ship7 is clean
local:ship( local:ship7 ) 
local:hold( local:ship7 ?h ) 
local:status( ?h local:clean )

The next query asks whether ship7 is a large ship
local:size( ship7 local:large )
Yes


An extended query then asks whether ship7 is a large ship and its hold is clean and double hulled
local:size( ship7 local:large )
local:hold( local:ship7 ?h ) 
local:status( ?h local:clean ) 
local:hull( ?h local:double )

We now proceed to the relational-query portion of this traversal. The following
query asks whether ship7 meets the safety requirements
MeetsSafetyRequirementsUnloaded(ship7) 
Yes

The next query asks whether ship7 has a valid certificate
HasValidCertificate(ship7) 
Yes

The query of this traversal asks whether ship7 complies with the requirements of the inspection for unloaded ships. It can be proved by Rule 3 based on the previous two (sub)queries.
CompliesInspectionRequirementsUnloaded(ship7) 
Yes

Next, some non-ground queries that can extract interesting content from the KB. The following query asks for the size of ship1 [3].
local:size( ship1 ?z )

The subsequent query asks for any large ship whose hold is clean.
local:size( ?s local:large )
local:hold( ?s ?h ) 
local:status( ?h local:clean )


The next query asks for any ship that is large and has a valid certificate.
 local:HasValidCertificate(?s)
local:size( ?s local:large )

The final query asks for any ship that is small and meets the safety requirements
for unloaded ships.
local:MeetsSafetyRequirementsUnloaded(?s)
local:size( ?s local:small )
